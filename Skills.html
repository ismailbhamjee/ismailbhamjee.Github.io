											<h3>what are skills</h3>
											<p>Skills are things in which a person develops through experience or theory. 
											 In the case of data science these may include data cleaning, transformation, processing and selecting of the correct machine learning tools/ algorithm. Furthermore, understanding why things work is also a huge part of the skill set.</p>

												<h2>Natural language processing</h2>
												<p></p>

											<p>NLP Is the science of using mathematical computation of organise and extract meaning from words in a large corpus.
												Just like a human would but in a larger context. In regards to data science my main area of experts is in natural language processing as I wrote a thesis on it. 
												There are many facets of NLP from embedding words to measuring their sematic similarity.</p>

											<h2>Data processing</h2>
											<p>Correct data representation is when you select the correct data to use for your algorithm for it to work on desired results. For example, if you were to distinguish from apples and oranges you would naturally remove all non-spherical objects to allow the model to make accurate predictions.
												It is essential to use a data set which is representative to the cases you want to predict. If the set is too small then there will be sampling noise, too big and sampling bias might occur.</p>

											<h3>Data removal</h3>
											<p>If the data is not needed or does not provided any meaningful value then it should be removed at it make the rest of the system inefficient and inaccurate.
											 This is a viable option for whole attributes as well as individual cases. Also reduced dimensionality my help some algorithms perform better as well as using less computational resources. </p>

											<h3>Data repairs </h3>
											<p>If the data is missing and a logical approach can be found to “repair” the data then by all means it should be, this could be in the form of imputing from other records or even using the mean of the attribute if it seems appropriate.  </p>

											<h3> Data transfomation </h3>
											<p>Data may not always be in a state which it can be used, so transformation allows us to change the data into a more appropriate manner. For example, if I have money in word format then it would be appropriate to transform it into numerical. 
											From numerical we can transform it into binary, if they are a limited number of values.   </p>

                                            <h2> machine learning</h2>
											<p> </p>

											<h3> Over fitting</h3>
											<p>Overfitting is when the model chosen is only able to perform well on the data set it was given and is unable to generalise on others. This often happens when the model is too complex relative to the noise of the data. To solve this, we can use algorithms with fewer attributes which will lead to fewer parameters. 
												Furthermore, removing outliers with addition to more data for training will help </p>
												
											<h3>Underfitting</h3>
											<p>This is when the model is too simple and lacks suitable parameters for the task. Such as using linear regression on a data set which nonlinear.
												 However, this can be quickly soled using a better model with a more suitable set of parameters along with reducing constraints on a model.   </p>

											<h3> testing & validation </h3>
											<p>A huge part of machine learning is to see if the model we have chosen works and is able to predict new records.
												 A way of doing this is to split the data set into a training set and a testing set. This split is dependent on the quantity of data in the set usually around 90% to 10%.  By looking at how well the algorithm performs on the test set, an out of sample error (generalisation error) is known.
												 Which shows how well the model performs on unknown instances. </p>
