												<h2>What is a thesis?</h2>
												<p>An empirical thesis is typically work conducted on a scientific level at the end of a degree.
													 It is primarily based on data and can/ could be replicated if needed. </p>
												<p> This project usually accounts for 1/3 of the academic year it is done in. Or in some cases 1/3 of the whole degree.
													 It is a culmination and representation of all the skills and knowledge you have learnt during your time in education.  </p>

											<h3>Evaluating flood disaster tweets through the use of text 
												mining </h3>


											<p>With the increased usage of social media, information regarding major events has become more 
												abundant. During these times people express their views on what is happening in their local 
												surroundings via various mediums. 
												</p>

											<p>This gives rise to the potential of using such data to better understand and react to events such as 
												floods. 
												</p>

											<p>Whereas traditional Methods such as image analysis are not suitable for understanding the impact 
												such events have on the local community. Thus, we opted for tweet analysis as they are more 
												personal to the event and community. 
												</p>

											<p>This paper hopes to develop system in which tweets are used and processed until the level of 
												assigning a risk factor to them. This would subsequently aim to help local authorities in the west 
												Yorkshire primarily the bradford city council understand the damage alongside future risks. This 
												paper will traverse through the necessary steps which are needed for the project to work. Alongside 
												any meaningful discoveries. 
												</p>

												<h3>Conclusion of the work conducted</h3>
												<p>Twitter is a microblogging website which allows users to state whatever they want via their account. 
													Having said this, we researched usage of this feature during crisis and public related events. During 
													this we found many works which used tweets as a monitoring system or extraction system. </p>

												<p>We also found out that the publics tweets are more likely to be genuine during these events. This led 
													to the motivation to develop our algorithms. we aimed to create a program which would enable us 
													to retrieve tweets which were then processed in order to be suitable for NLP vectorisation. We 
													initially started with 3 embedding models but only 2 of them made it to our current stage in pipeline. </p>

												<p>Furthermore, the system of classification we implemented judging by our results worked but had to 
													be improved in regards to topic mapping and pre LDA classification. We found it difficult to assign 
													topics in some clusters and some topics were overlapping in certain clusters. </p>
													

												<p> Overall, we came shy of our goal due to missing a classification layer but reached a model with high 
													potential.</p>


												
													<span class="image featured"><img src="images/dsg.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												
												<p>Overall the experience was amazing. I'd recomend anyone to persue data science.</p>

											<h3>Methodology </h3>
											<p>As with any project or operation we would need a plan or a method of conducting activities. We 
												used anacondaâ€™s distribution which allowed to import the needed libraries with ease. For 
												development we used Jupiter notebook as it allows ease of use and it was fairly simple to use 
												regarding executing code blocks.  </p>

											<h1>Step by step procedure </h1>

											<ol>
												<li>The first step would be to retrieve key words which reflect the events which occurred during 
													the flooding period of 2015. </li>
													
                                                <li>Second would be to retrieve tweets which contain relevance to the key words and events 
													which ae also suitable for text mining. 
													</li>

                                                <li>evaluate and process the tweets which includes cleaning and making them eligible for word 
													vectorisation.</li>

												<li>Next the tweets are vectorised using different methods word2vec, fast text and doc2vec. 
													With addition of visualisation of vectors in relation to each other.</li>

												<li>Perform unsupervised classification on the tweets to see how further they can be grouped 
													together. </li>

												<li>Next, we will perform topic modelling which will enable us to derive suitable topics from the 
													clusters.</li>

												<li>Lastly, we will test tweets via attempted allocation to the correct cluster and then topic.</li>
